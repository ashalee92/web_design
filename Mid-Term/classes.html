                <h3>Here are some of the races you can choose from:</h3>

                <ul>
                    <li>Dragonborn - Dragonborn look very much like dragons standing erect in humanoid form, though they lack wings or a tail.</li>
                    <li>Dwarf - Bold and hardy, dwarvevs are known as skilled warriors, miners, and workers of stone and metal.</li>
                    <li>Elf - Elves are magical people of otherworldly grace, living in the world but not entirely part of it.</li>
                    <li>Gnome - A gnome's energy and enthusiasm for living shines through every inch of his or her tiny body.</li>
                    <li>Half-elf - Half-elves combine what some say are the best qualities of their elf and human parents.</li>
                    <li>Halfling - The diminutive halflings survive in a world full of larger creatures by avoiding notice or, barring that, avoiding offense.</li>
                    <li>Half-orc - Half-orcs' grayish pigmentation, sloping foreheads, jutting jaws, prominent teeth, and towering builds make their orcish heritage plain for all to see.</li>
                    <li>Human - Humans are the most adaptable and ambitious people among the common race. Whatever drives them, humans are the innovators, the achievers, and the poineers of the worlds.</li>
                    <li>Tiefling - To be greeted with stares and whispers, to suffer violence and insult on the street, to see mistrust and fear in every eye: this is the lot of the tiefling.</li>
                    <li>There are many more, this is just the basic ones that are in the player's handbook. I suggest looking on the website for even more races.</li>
