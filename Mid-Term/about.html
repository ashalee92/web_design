                <p>It had early successes, which then led others to try to create similar games. Even though people have tried to make something similar D&D has remained the market leader in the role-playing industry. Even though there have been different versions it has still remained the best-known and best-selling role-playing game in the U.S. Now you are able to buy games based off of shows that have gained a ton of attention such as Rick and Morty and Stranger Things.</p><br>
