                <h2><u>The World of Dungeons and Dragons</u></h2>

                <p>Have you ever wanted to get into a roleplay game? Have you ever wanted someone or yourself to create a world that is made up of all kinds of mythical creatures, mystifying tale, lots of drinking, and split second desicions? Then you should give Dungeons and Dragons a go.</p><br>

                <img class="races" src="Images/DnD_MM_Art.jpg" alt="DnD Monster"><br>

                <p>You can literally do anything you would want just as long as your dice do not fail you. You come up with who you want to be, what you want to master and go from there level by level until the Dungeon Master kills you off or you kill yourself to create a new character. All you need for a game is friends and a lively imagination. Dungeons and Dragons is boasted as the first role-playing game and it remains to be one of the best ones around. Many games owe D&D to have helped spark the creativity for them and even writers have been inspired after a campaign. </p><br>
