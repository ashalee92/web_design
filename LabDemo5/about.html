                <h2><u>About</u></h2>
                <p>Pokemon began in Japan in 1996 by Satoshi Tajiri, Ken Sugimori, and Junichi Masuda. The premise of the franchise is there are fictional creatures called Pokemon, and humans, also known as Pokemon Trainers, can catch and battle with the Pokemon.  </p>

                <p>The franchise started with a game called Pocket Monsters: Red and Green for the GameBoy systems. Very soon after that it became very popular and has been the highest grossest franchise of all time. It went from video games, to trading cards, to an anime series to even more. We just celebrated the 25th anniversary.</p>
