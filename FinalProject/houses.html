            <h1>The Four Houses of Hogwarts</h1>
            <p>There are four houses in Hogwarts School of Wizardry. The houses are place meant for living and learning. And each House has a way of winning or losing points which at the end of the year gives them a chance to win the House Cup.</p>

            <p>The four founders of Hogwarts would hand pick students when they were alive, but feared what they would do after their inevitable deaths. So Godric Gryffindor created the sorting hat. So every year at the very beginning the new students would be apart of a Sorting Ceremony. The sorting hat is placed on their head and tells which house each student will be apart of for the next four years.</p>

            <p>Each house has its own space in the castle located at various areas. Each one containing a common room and the dormitory. Where students spend most of their time with their own housemates. Each house also has its own table in the Great Hall. And the students interact with their own House mainly, but classes are with other Houses and they are allowed to interact with anyone they want to. Most stick to who is in their own House though.</p>
