    <p>I have a black cat and he is my child. Black cats are my favorite color of cat. I know that shelters have a hard time getting black cats adopted and everytime I see one I am tempted to go snag it. </p>

    <p>I love animated images, and this is no exception. Add beatiful scenery to it and I am sold. </p>
