    <p>This is my old gym that is now Synergy Climbing and Ninja. This along with so many other gyms is a great way to start climbing, get to know people, and also keep in shape. I love going to the gym, it makes me feel better at the end of the day. So if you want to try bouldering get a day pass at a local gym.</p>
